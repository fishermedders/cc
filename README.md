ComputerCraft Programs Repository
Welcome! I am very glad that you are here!
This Repository is for my ComputerCraft Programs that I write.

Feel free to use my code, as it is under MIT license, just give me credit ;)

The versions of the programs will be documented in the code.
Also, if you need an emulator and don't want to load up a minecraft environment, or even just want
a lightweight online emulator, be sure to check out http://gravlann.github.io/
Also, for more info on computercraft, go to http://computercraft.info/

Happy Computing
